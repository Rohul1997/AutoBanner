# AutoBanner
For BlargVC SNES from here https://github.com/Ryuzaki-MrL/blargVC

This is something that I wrote that does all of the Ohana3DS banner work automatically. I made this to work with BlargVC SNES. The process would normally take 5-10 mins but with this script it will take about a minute.

All you do is run and type in your games folder name and then just wait and watch and it should do all of the work for you.

# Requirements
• This will only work if you set your screen resolution to: 1366 x 768
To check/change this you just go on:

Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalisation -> Display -> Adjust Resolution

Control Panel\Appearance and Personalisation\Display\Screen Resolution

• Python. I used Python (2.7.11)
