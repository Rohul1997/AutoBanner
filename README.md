# AutoBanner
For BlargVC SNES from here https://github.com/Ryuzaki-MrL/blargVC

This is something that I wrote that does all of the Ohana3DS banner work automatically. I made this to work with BlargVC SNES. The process would normally take 5-10 mins but with this script it will take about a minute.

# Usage
Download AutoBanner.py and place it inside BlargVC folder where the banner.bat, make.bat and update.bat files a located.
Before running Autobanner make sure you create the banner images by running banner.bat. When it asks if you want to run Ohana3DS just close the command window. Then you run AutoBanner.py and type in your games folder name and press enter. Finally just wait and watch and it should do all of the work for you.

# Requirements
• This will only work if you set your screen resolution to: 1366 x 768

To check/change the resolution just go on:

Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalisation -> Display -> Adjust Resolution

Control Panel\Appearance and Personalisation\Display\Screen Resolution

• Python. I used Python (2.7.11)
